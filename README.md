## Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms are designed to retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. This section includes:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator. This section includes:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

## Stack and Its Applications
A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). This section includes:
- Basic Stack Operations
- Expression Evaluation
- Balancing Parentheses
- Infix to Postfix Conversion
- Decimal to Binary conversion

## Queues
A queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). This section includes:
- Basic Queue Operations
- Circular Queue

## Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are stored in nodes. Each node points to the next node by means of a pointer. This section includes:
- Basic Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Searching)
-Implementing Singly Linked list
-Stack using Singly Linked List

## Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node in the sequence. This section includes:
- Basic Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Searching)
- Implementing a Doubly Linked List

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have an algorithm or data structure that you would like to add, please:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
